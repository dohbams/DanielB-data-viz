# Welcome to my viz journal!!


## Objective
This repo is dedicated to sharing my personal data visualization projects and adventures with others.

The majority of my visualization work is written in R, but there will be Python vizzes as well; folders will include datasets and code files. The code files will have comments that will help you through the many phases of creating the visualization.
